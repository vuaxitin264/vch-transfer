# VCH Transfer Frontend

This folder contains a minimal React application bootstrapped with Vite and
TailwindCSS. It provides a basic dashboard placeholder for the VCH Transfer
project. You can extend this UI to build forms and tables for managing invoices
and recipients.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app will be served at `http://localhost:5173`.

## TailwindCSS

Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. To start
styling your components, simply add Tailwind utility classes to your JSX
elements. See `src/App.jsx` for an example.
